# Introduction

The relationship between the escalating concentrations of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), and the increases in global average temperatures support contemporary understanding of climate dynamics. This connection not only highlights the anthropogenic impacts on climate change but also serves as a critical point for scientific questions aimed at explaining the effects and potential mitigation strategies for global warming.

Historical and modern scientific efforts have greatly contributed to the understanding of this relationship. Eunice Foote and, later in the 19th century, John Tyndall, with their pioneering experiments, both proved the heat-trapping characteristics of CO₂, as part of the basic knowledge toward the greenhouse effect, which is necessary for modern-day climatic science (Armstrong et al., 2018). In the 20th century, scientists, including Mann et al. (1998), further attempted to provide an explanation for the dominant role of the gases in recent climate variability and to confirm the continual impact that had already been observed in earlier research by using paleoclimatic information to link changes in greenhouse gas concentrations with large-scale temperature patterns.
The most recent studies, for instance, Hansen et al. (2006) and Mann et al. (1998), have not only upheld the early findings with great analysis but have continued to argue out how these gases influence modern climatic patterns. Their work indeed underscores near effects of these gases and points out to the constant increase in the temperatures around the world, which is in line with past predictions and models that sought to establish the trajectory of climate change.

They increasingly report that the increase of world temperatures is very much related to rising sea levels—one of those things they are seeing more often in climate studies of recent years. Mitchell (1989) pointed out that the enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations have warmed not only the atmosphere but have also contributed to its thermal expansion, melting ice caps, which have emerged as major factors for the increased observed rise in sea levels over the past century.

Building on these foundational experiments and studies, the present research aims to delve deeper into the correlations and causal relationships between the increases in specific greenhouse gases with global temperature trends. Using context from these studies and modern technological and methodological advances, this piece of work contributes to having a more cohesive understanding of the mechanisms involved in climate change by potentially confirming or challenging past findings.


# Methods

## Research Objective
The following research aim's to identify the relationship between particular greenhouse gases (CO₂ and CH₄) and global average temperature. Additionally, I want to investigate the effects that global average temperature has on sea levels. The discoveries made will be pivotal for enhancing the accuracy of climate models, which are crucial for predicting and mitigating future climate impacts. Hopefully the results can better inform policy decisions and develop effective strategies for protecting coastal communities and ecosystems against the impending rise of global temperatures and sea levels.

### Null Hypotheses (H<sub>0</sub>):
- There is no significant linear relationship between the levels of CO₂, CH₄, and changes in global average temperature.

- There is no significant linear relationship between rising sea levels and global average temperature.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>):
- There is a significant linear relationship between CO₂, CH₄, and changes in global average temperature.

- There is a significant linear relationship between rising sea levels and global average temperature. 

## Data Analyses

### Data

The data comes from [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/?intent=111). The files themselves are only downloadable in .txt format, so I used used Python to convert these files into .csv format for easier data observation and manipulation. As a first step, let's go ahead and load in the datasets:

```{r, message=FALSE}
co2_data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammeadss/climate/main/Data/CarbonDioxide.csv')
methane_data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammeadss/climate/main/Data/Methane.csv')
temp_data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammeadss/climate/main/Data/GlobalTemp.csv')
sealevel_data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammeadss/climate/main/Data/SeaLevel.csv')
```

### Descriptive Statistics

Now that the data is loaded, it's important to follow up with a summary of the datasets' contents. This is a key step before continuing with more complex data analysis; it can help identify trends, patterns, or anomalies by displaying the basic features that the dataset has to offer.   
```{r}
kable(summary(co2_data), format = "markdown", caption = "<b>Carbon Dioxide Data</b>")
kable(summary(methane_data), format = "markdown", caption = "<b>Methane Data</b>")
kable(summary(temp_data), format = "markdown", caption = "<b>Global Temperature Data</b>")
kable(summary(sealevel_data), format = "markdown", caption = "<b>Sea Level Data</b>")
```

Once the summaries load, carefully examine all four tables to possibly identify any trends, patterns, or anomalies. After doing this with my data, nothing in particular jumped out at me, which is typical with larger datasets. However, I noticed that the range for the Year(s) columns on all four datasets are different; this means I will have to clean up the data so that when I eventually merge the datasets, there won't be any inconsistencies.

### Data Wrangling

In this phase of the analysis, I focus on preparing the data by cleaning and structurally organizing it into distinct data frames. This methodical separation ensures that any transformations or manipulations do not compromise the integrity of the original datasets. Each data frame is associated with their respective environmental measures: CO₂ levels, CH₄ concentrations, global temperatures, and sea levels.

To begin, I create new data frames from the original datasets. Naming these data frames explicitly by their content and scope—such as 'co2_annual' and 'methane_annual'—facilitates clearer, more organized analysis later on. This step is crucial, especially when dealing with time-series data that spans multiple years, ensuring that analyses remain consistent across comparable temporal ranges.

For the greenhouse gases analysis, which includes both CO₂ and CH₄ data, I apply specific filters and transformations to align these datasets with the period for which complete records are available. Given that the CH₄ data begins in 1984, I filter the CO₂ and temperature datasets to start from this year as well, ensuring that the analysis only covers overlapping periods for accurate comparisons and correlations.

```{r}
co2_annual <- co2_data %>%
  filter(Year >= 1984) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(AnnualAverageCO2 = mean(`Monthly Average`, na.rm = TRUE))

methane_annual <- methane_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(AnnualAverageMethane = mean(Mean, na.rm = TRUE))

temp_annual <- temp_data %>%
  filter(Year >= 1984) %>%
  select(Year, No_Smoothing) %>%
  rename(AnnualAverageTemp = No_Smoothing)
```

For the sea level analysis, I modify the sea level dataset to extract the year from the 'Year + Fraction of Year' column and then group the data annually. This grouping allows for averaging the sea level measurements over each year, which is critical for observing long-term trends and reducing temporal noise in the data.

Also in this segment of data preparation, I refine the global temperature dataset to align it specifically for analysis with sea level data. This transformation is crucial for ensuring that temperature data is accurately represented and can be effectively compared with sea level changes over the same years.

```{r}
sealevel_annual <- sealevel_data %>%
  mutate(Year = floor(`Year + Fraction of Year`)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Smoothed_GMSL = mean(`Smoothed GMSL (No GIA) (mm)`))

tempsea_annual <- temp_data %>%
  select(Year, No_Smoothing) %>%
  rename(AnnualAverageTemp = No_Smoothing)
```

Now that I have cleaned and organized the data, I can merge the dataframes for greenhouse gas analysis. The focus is on consolidating annual measurements of CO₂ levels, methane concentrations, and global temperature anomalies into a single dataset.

```{r}
greenhouse_merged <- merge(co2_annual, methane_annual, by = "Year")
greenhouse_merged <- merge(greenhouse_merged, temp_annual, by = "Year")
head(greenhouse_merged)
```

Same thing for the sea level analysis.

```{r}
sealevel_merged <- merge(tempsea_annual, sealevel_annual, by = "Year")
structure(sealevel_merged)
```

### Time Series Analysis 

In this section of analysis, I employ time series plots to visually represent the trends in CO₂ levels, methane concentrations, global temperature anomalies, and sea level changes over time. These plots are critical for understanding the temporal dynamics of each environmental parameter and for assessing their potential impacts on climate change.

The first plot focuses on the trend in CO₂ levels over the years.

```{r}
ggplot(data = greenhouse_merged, aes(x = Year, y = AnnualAverageCO2)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("CO2 Levels Over Time") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("CO2 Levels (ppm)") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))

```

Methane, another critical greenhouse gas, is tracked in the second plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = greenhouse_merged, aes(x = Year, y = AnnualAverageMethane)) +
  geom_line(color = "green") +
  ggtitle("Methane Concentrations Over Time") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Methane (ppb)") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

Next, I examine the trend in global temperature anomalies. This plot will help us identify periods of significant temperature increases or decreases and correlate these trends with the data on greenhouse gases.

```{r}
ggplot(data = greenhouse_merged, aes(x = Year, y = AnnualAverageTemp)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Global Temperature Anomalies Over Time") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Temperature Anomaly (C°)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

Lastly, I plot the changes in global mean sea level, which have been adjusted for non-climatic factors such as gravitational and elastic effects (No GIA).

```{r}
  ggplot(sealevel_merged, aes(x = Year, y = Smoothed_GMSL)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("Global Mean Sea Level Changes Over Time (Smoothed, No GIA)") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Sea Level Change (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))

```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Now I'll utilize scatter plots to visually explore the relationships between key environmental metrics: CO₂ levels, methane concentrations, and sea levels, each compared against global temperature anomalies. These plots are instrumental in identifying potential correlations and establishing a basis for further statistical analysis.

The first scatter plot examines the relationship between CO₂ levels (ppm) and global temperature anomalies (C°). By visualizing these variables, I aim to identify how fluctuations in CO₂ concentrations may correlate with changes in global temperatures, which is central to understanding the impact of this predominant greenhouse gas

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = greenhouse_merged, aes(x = AnnualAverageCO2, y = AnnualAverageTemp)) +
  geom_point(color = "brown", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("CO2 Levels vs. Global Temp Anomalies") +
  xlab("CO2 Levels (ppm)") +
  ylab("Global Temp Anomaly (C°)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

Next, I explore the association between methane concentrations (ppb) and global temperature anomalies. Methane, being a potent greenhouse gas, might exhibit a moderate to strong correlation with temperature anomalies, offering insights into its relative climatic impact compared to CO₂.

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = greenhouse_merged, aes(x = AnnualAverageMethane, y = AnnualAverageTemp)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "green") +
  ggtitle("Methane Concentrations vs. Global Temp Anomalies") +
  xlab("Methane (ppb)") +
  ylab("Global Temp Anomaly (C°)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Lastly, this plot correlates changes in sea levels with global temperature anomalies. The analysis seeks to demonstrate if and how temperature changes influence sea level fluctuations, an essential factor in assessing climate change impacts.

```{r, message=FALSE}
  ggplot(data = sealevel_merged, aes(x = Smoothed_GMSL, y = AnnualAverageTemp)) +
  geom_point(color = "brown", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("CO2 Levels vs. Global Temp Anomalies") +
  xlab("CO2 Levels (ppm)") +
  ylab("Global Temp Anomaly (C°)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

### Correlation Tests

Following the organization and visualization of the data, the next crucial step in analysis is to conduct statistical tests to evaluate the strength and significance of the correlations identified during the exploratory phase. These tests are essential to substantiate the relationships hypothesized between greenhouse gas levels and global temperature anomalies. The results will help confirm or refute the initial assumptions laid out in the research objectives.

To rigorously assess the relationships posited between CO₂ and methane concentrations and global temperature anomalies, I employ Pearson's product-moment correlation tests. These tests will quantify the linear relationships between these variables, providing a statistical basis to either reject or fail to reject the null hypotheses formulated earlier.

I begin by examining the linear correlation between annual average CO₂ levels and global temperature anomalies. This test aims to quantify the strength of association, offering insights into how CO₂ emissions may be driving changes in global temperatures.

```{r}
cor.test(greenhouse_merged$AnnualAverageCO2, greenhouse_merged$AnnualAverageTemp)
```

Similarly, I conduct a correlation test for methane concentrations against global temperature anomalies. Given methane's potency as a greenhouse gas, this analysis is critical to understanding its comparative impact on climate change alongside CO₂.

```{r}
cor.test(greenhouse_merged$AnnualAverageMethane, greenhouse_merged$AnnualAverageTemp)
```

Finally, a correlation test for global mean sea level against global average temperature anomalies.

```{r}
cor.test(sealevel_merged$Smoothed_GMSL, sealevel_merged$AnnualAverageTemp)
```

### Regression Analysis

Building on the foundational correlation analysis, the next analytical step involves employing regression techniques to delve deeper into the causal relationships suggested by the observed correlations. This regression analysis aims to provide quantitative insights into how changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and sea levels are associated with alterations in global temperature anomalies.

To quantitatively assess the impact of CO₂ and methane on global temperature anomalies, I'll construct a multiple linear regression model. This model will enable us to isolate the effect of each gas on temperature changes, adjusting for the presence of the other gas. This analysis is critical, as it goes beyond correlation by estimating the actual impact (in terms of temperature change) that can be attributed to each unit increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.

```{r}
greenhouse_regression = lm(AnnualAverageTemp ~ AnnualAverageCO2 + AnnualAverageMethane , data = greenhouse_merged)
summary(greenhouse_regression)
```

Similarly, to explore the relationship between rising sea levels and global temperature anomalies, I'll perform a linear regression analysis. This model seeks to quantify how changes in sea levels are potentially driven by global temperature changes, providing a statistical basis to understand the dynamics of sea level rise in the context of global warming.

```{r}
sealevel_regression = lm(AnnualAverageTemp ~ Smoothed_GMSL, data = sealevel_merged)
summary(sealevel_regression)
```

# Results

Let's recap the findings from the correlation tests and regression analysis:

## CO₂ and Global Average Temperature

The correlation coefficient of 0.9376913 indicates a very strong positive correlation between annual average CO₂ levels and global temperature anomalies. This means as CO₂ levels increase, global temperatures also tend to increase.

The t-value of 16.415 with 37 degrees of freedom shows the statistical strength of the correlation. This high t-value indicates that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.

The p-value < 2.2e-16 (extremely small) strongly suggests rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between CO₂ levels and global temperatures. This low p-value indicates that the probability of observing such a strong correlation by chance (if there were no actual correlation) is extremely low.

The interval from 0.8835916 to 0.9670880 suggests with 95% confidence that the true correlation coefficient between CO₂ levels and global temperatures lies within this range. The range does not include zero, reinforcing the significance of the correlation.

## CH₄ and Global Average Temperature 

The correlation coefficient of 0.911116 also indicates a very strong positive correlation between annual average methane levels and global temperature anomalies. As methane levels increase, global temperatures also tend to increase similarly.

The t-value of 13.447 with 37 degrees of freedom again highlights the strength of the correlation, indicating it is significantly different from zero.

The p-value of 8.131e-16 (also extremely small) leads to a rejection of the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between methane levels and global temperatures. This indicates a very low likelihood that this strong correlation is due to random chance.

The confidence interval from 0.8358962 to 0.9527449 similarly indicates that with 95% confidence, the true correlation coefficient lies within this range. Again, the interval does not include zero, supporting the significance of the correlation.

## Sea Levels and Global Average Temperature

The correlation coefficient of 0.6148028 suggests a moderate positive relationship between sea level changes and global average temperatures. This indicates that as global temperatures rise, sea levels also tend to increase, but the relationship is not perfectly linear or extremely strong.

The t-value of 2.0625 with 7 degrees of freedom suggests that the observed correlation is just over two times the standard error away from zero; the 7 degrees of freedom likely reflects the small sample size (n = 9, since df = n - 2 for correlation tests). A smaller sample size can limit the reliability of the correlation estimate.

The p-value of 0.07808, which is greater than the conventional alpha level of 0.05, suggests that the correlation, while suggestive of a positive relationship, is not statistically significant at the 5% level. This means we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between sea level changes and global temperatures.

Finally, the confidence interval from -0.08335174 to 0.90813107 is quite wide and includes negative values, which further indicates uncertainty about the strength of the relationship. The fact that it crosses zero suggests that, statistically, there is a considerable chance that there could be no effective correlation between the variables. However, the upper limit being close to 1 indicates that a strong positive correlation is also possible, reflecting the uncertainty due to possibly having a small sample size.

# Conclusion

This research set out to explore the relationships between greenhouse gases—specifically carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄)—and global average temperature, as well as the implications of rising global temperatures on sea levels. The study greatly boosted my understanding of the dynamics of greenhouse gases and their effect on global temperature and sea levels. It highlights the critical need for robust environmental policies and further research to explore complex interactions within the Earth's climate system. The findings underscore the urgency of addressing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO₂, as part of global strategies against climate change. Future studies are recommended to continue this line of inquiry, employing larger and more detailed datasets to unravel the intricate patterns of climate change further.

## Key Findings 

### Strong Correlation between Greenhouse Gases and Temperature
The analysis confirmed a very strong positive correlation between both CO₂ and methane concentrations and global average temperatures. The Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.9377 for CO₂ and 0.9111 for methane are indicative of robust linear relationships, significantly supporting the alternative hypothesis that these gases are linearly related to increases in global temperatures.

### Moderate Correlation between Sea Level and Temperature
The relationship between sea levels and global temperatures, while moderate (correlation coefficient of 0.6148), was not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level (p-value = 0.07808). This suggests that while there is some indication of a relationship, the evidence is not strong enough to conclusively assert a linear correlation at this level of significance.

### Regression Analysis Insights
The regression models further quantified the impacts of these variables. The model including both CO₂ and methane explained a substantial portion of the variance in global temperatures, with an R-squared value of 0.8793, confirming the significant predictive power of these gases. However, the impact of methane, when adjusted for CO₂, was not significant, highlighting CO₂'s predominant role.
The regression model for sea levels and temperatures showed a weaker relationship, with an R-squared of 0.378, indicating that sea level changes explain a smaller portion of the variance in global temperatures within the observed data set.

## Implications for Climate Science and Policy

### Model Validation and Improvement
These results validate the significant role of CO₂ and, to a lesser extent, methane in influencing global temperature changes. This reinforces the need for climate models to incorporate these gases accurately to predict future climatic conditions effectively.

### Policy Development
With the proven strong influence of CO₂ on temperature, policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions are validated as essential to controlling global warming. Although the direct relationship between temperature and sea levels was less clear, the general trend suggests rising temperatures could influence sea levels, justifying continued emphasis on policies to prepare for and mitigate sea level rise.

### Further Research
The moderate and non-significant correlation between sea levels and temperatures suggests that additional factors or more complex models might be necessary to fully understand and predict sea level dynamics. Further research with larger datasets, or incorporating additional variables such as polar ice melt rates and oceanic thermal expansion, could provide more insights.
