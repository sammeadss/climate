# Introduction

The relationship between the escalating concentrations of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), and the increases in global average temperatures support contemporary understanding of climate dynamics. This connection not only highlights the anthropogenic impacts on climate change but also serves as a critical point for scientific questions aimed at explaining the effects and potential mitigation strategies for global warming.

Historical and modern scientific efforts have greatly contributed to the understanding of this relationship. Eunice Foote and, later in the 19th century, John Tyndall, with their pioneering experiments, both proved the heat-trapping characteristics of CO₂, as part of the basic knowledge toward the greenhouse effect, which is necessary for modern-day climatic science (Armstrong et al., 2018). In the 20th century, scientists, including Mann et al. (1998), further attempted to provide an explanation for the dominant role of the gases in recent climate variability and to confirm the continual impact that had already been observed in earlier research by using paleoclimatic information to link changes in greenhouse gas concentrations with large-scale temperature patterns.
The most recent studies, for instance, Hansen et al. (2006) and Mann et al. (1998), have not only upheld the early findings with great analysis but have continued to argue out how these gases influence modern climatic patterns. Some of these include changes in SSTs and their link to key climate events such as the El Niño. His work, through the documentary, indeed underscores near effects of these gases and points out to the constant increase in the temperatures around the world, which is in line with past predictions and models that sought to establish the trajectory of climate change.

They increasingly report that the increase of world temperatures is very much related to rising sea levels—one of those things they are seeing more often in climate studies of recent years. Mitchell (1989) pointed out that the enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations have warmed not only the atmosphere but have also contributed to its thermal expansion, melting ice caps, which have emerged as major factors for the increased observed rise in sea levels over the past century.

Building on these foundational experiments and studies, the present research aims to delve deeper into the correlations and causal relationships between the increases in specific greenhouse gases with global temperature trends. Using context from these studies and modern technological and methodological advances, this piece of work contributes to having a more cohesive understanding of the mechanisms involved in climate change by potentially confirming or challenging past findings.
